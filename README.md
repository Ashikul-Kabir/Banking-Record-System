# Banking-Record-System
This project includes using the system as various kinds of users
with various level of privileges. One can enter into the program as:
• Admin
• Employee or
• Customer
These three kinds of users will have different privileges:
• Admin will get the most number of privileges. An admin can
add new admins, employees & customers modifying their data.
He/She can access all the accounts and see the informations.
He/She can also modify the data such as perform deletion on
records of customers or employees.
• Employees can add new customers or modify information
except for the private ones.
• Customers can open their accounts. Logging into an account, a
customer can withdraw or deposit money.
• All of the privileges will be protected by passwords.
During our coding, we will use few easy steps in an
understandable manner using various functions(i. e. search,
addRecord, deleteRecord, editRecord etc.) to build up the
program. All the informations will be stored initially in multiple
text files to access throughout the main program.

-> All the above mentioned tasks were carried out only for customers. User can modify the sections for admin & employee also; after getting a very profound knowledge on OOP using c++ language.
