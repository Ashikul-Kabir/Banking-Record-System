This project allows a user to set different levels of privileges while logging into the system. One can enter into the program as: 
• Admin 
• Employee or 
• Customer 

These three kinds of users will have their privileges: 
• Admin will get the maximum privileges. An admin can add new admins, employees & customers by modifying their data. Moreover, he/she can access all the accounts to see the information and modify the data, such as performing deletion on records of customers or employees. 
• Employees can add new customers or modify information except for the private ones. 
• Customers can open their accounts. By logging in, a customer can withdraw or deposit money. 
• All of the privileges will be protected by passwords. During our coding, we will use a few easy steps in an understandable manner using various functions(e.g., search, addRecord, deleteRecord, editRecord, etc.) to build up the program. All the information is stored initially in multiple text files to access throughout the main program.


-> All the above-mentioned tasks were carried out only for customers. Users can modify the sections for admin & employee as well.
